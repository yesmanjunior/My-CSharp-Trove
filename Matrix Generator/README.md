## Matrix Generator v3.0

### As of this version, it features: 
- Dynamic row-column generation;
- Option for choosing elements' value range
- Matrix transpose function

### To-do list
- Multiplication/division for upper/lower-diagonal elements;
- Better code look

### P.S.
You may find the codes atrocious and messy, so bear with me while I figure it all out.
